# Terrain Classification Model

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the Auburn Waves, SOI 2024 competition. The objective was to create a robust model that accurately predicts the terrain type based on input images.

## Dataset

The dataset provided includes:
- **Training Images**: 6201 images available at aum27/mars-terrain
- **Test Images**: 2000 images available at aum27/mars-terrain-test

## Model

We employed the Vision Transformer (ViT) model to achieve the classification. This model was chosen for its effectiveness in handling image data and its ability to capture complex patterns in visual information.

## Project Structure

- **`train_and_test.ipynb`**: An IPython notebook that includes code for training and testing the model.
- **`report.md`**: A detailed report outlining the project objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- **`contributions.md`**: Document detailing the contributions of each team member.
- **`predictions.csv`**: CSV file containing the model's predictions on the test dataset.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the Auburn Waves, SOI 2024 organizers for providing the dataset and the opportunity to participate in this competition.
