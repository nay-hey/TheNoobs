Terrain Classification Model
Overview
This project was developed as part of the Auburn Waves, SOI 2024 competition. The objective was to create a robust model that accurately predicts the terrain type based on input images.

Dataset
The dataset provided includes:

Training Images: 6201 images
Test Images: 2000 images
Model
We employed the Vision Transformer (ViT) model to achieve the classification. This model was chosen for its effectiveness in handling image data and its ability to capture complex patterns in visual information.

Project Structure
ViT.ipynb: An IPython notebook that includes code for training and testing the model.
report: A detailed report outlining the project objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
contributions: Document detailing the contributions of each team member.
predictions.csv: CSV file containing the model's predictions on the test dataset.

Use the provided notebook to preprocess the input images. This includes resizing, normalization, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.
Train the Model:

Run the training code in train_and_test.ipynb. This will train the ViT model on the training dataset.
Evaluate and Test:

After training, evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset. The results and predictions will be saved in predictions.csv.
